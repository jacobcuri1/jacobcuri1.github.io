				<h1>Common exercises</h1>
				<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine</p>
				<dl>
					
					<dt>Burpee</dt>
					<dd>Burpees are great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a dquatted position.</dd>
					
					<dt>Planks</dt>
					<dd>Planks build your core strength. To preform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>
					
					<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
					<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardo exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
