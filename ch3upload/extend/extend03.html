            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p> Descriptive titles for images are important because they allow you to know what the image is without opening the file.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p> I used Ms paint to resize my image but a free online resizer is linked above.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p> The original image was 2121x1414.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="html5Resize.jpg">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used the image compresser at imagecompressor.com. The original file size was at 29kb and the image compression software brought it down to about 5kb.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="html5Resize-min.jpg">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p></p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
               <svg height="60" width="75" >
			   <circle r="20" cx="40" cy="40"  />
			   </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used w3schools.com to help make my circle.</p>
